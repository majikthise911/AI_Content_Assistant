# README for OpenAI Prompt Chaining 
## This code demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate blog post content by chaining multiple prompts together.

### Setup
First, the necessary packages are imported. These include:

streamlit: a Python library for building web apps
openai: the OpenAI API for generating natural language text
os: a module for interacting with the operating system
dotenv: a package for managing environment variables
tqdm: a package for adding progress bars to Python loops.
Environment variables are set up using dotenv to securely store the OpenAI API key.

### Usage
This program prompts the user to input the title of their blog post. The input is then passed through a series of prompts to generate a detailed table of contents and a blog post written in the style of Paul Graham. The generated output is then displayed in a text area on the webpage.

To run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is saved. Run the command streamlit run <filename> where <filename> is the name of the Python file.

Once the web app opens in your browser, enter the title of your blog post in the text input field and click the "Generate" button. The generated content will be displayed in the text area below. To copy the output to your clipboard, click the "Copy" button.

### Future Improvements
The following improvements can be made to this code:

Add user authentication so that users can post generated content directly to their Medium accounts.
Improve the readability and organization of the generated content by adding headings and subheadings.
